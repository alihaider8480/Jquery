                Sardines" is the first episode of Inside No. 9, a British dark comedy anthology series. 
                Written by Steve Pemberton (pictured) and Reece Shearsmith, it premiered on BBC Two on 5 February 2014. 
                In the episode, a group of adults play sardines at an engagement party. Rebecca, the bride-to-be, finds a
                player in a wardrobe, and they are subsequently joined by other guests. As more people enter, dark secrets 
                are revealed, with various allusions to incest, child abuse and adultery. The humour is dark and British, 
                with polite but awkward interactions. The story takes place entirely in the bedroom of a country house, 
                with much of it inside the wardrobe to evoke a feeling of claustrophobia. The cast included Katherine
                Parkinson, Tim Key, Luke Pasqualino, Ophelia Lovibond, Anne Reid, Julian Rhind-Tutt, Anna Chancellor,
                Marc Wootton, Ben Willbond, Timothy West and the two writers. The cast and writing were praised by critics, 
                and the episode was watched Pemberton (pictured) and Reece Shearsmith, it premiered on BBC Two on 5 February 2014.
